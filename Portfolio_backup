# Featured Project

## [Supply Chain - Buyer Execution Metrics – Global PO Risk Detection System](https://github.com/RuipingWang06/Career_Project_Portfolio_Ruiping/blob/main/Buyer_Execution_Metric.md) 

**Role:** BI Developer   
**Tech Stack:** Power BI, Power Apps, Snowflake, DAX, Power Query, Data Model, Deployment Pipelines, M-Parameters  
**Timeline:** April 2024-04 (Jabil – Global Procurement)

**Project Overview**

A global BI + workflow solution built for **100+ Jabil plants** to identify and manage **urgent, unexecuted purchase orders (POs)**.

Before this project, the lack of a **unified risk-identification process** caused:

- Delivery delays  
- Unnecessary or duplicate purchases  
- Recurring **multi-million-dollar losses**

This solution became part of Jabil’s **global procurement operating model**.

## [Power BI Metadata Governance](https://github.com/RuipingWang06/Career_Project_Portfolio_Ruiping/blob/main/PBI%20Governance.md)

**Role:** Data Engineer / BI Developer  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Docker, Azure Container Apps, Microsoft AIP, AWS S3, Snowflake, SQL, ETL  
**Timeline:** 2025 (Jabil – Global BI Governance)

**Project Overview**

A Power BI governance initiative to improve visibility and compliance across **1,000+ reports** globally.

We built an **Azure-hosted metadata ETL pipeline** where Python extracts report metadata via **Microsoft AIP**, loads it into **AWS S3**, and feeds **Snowflake models** that power centralized governance dashboards.

These dashboards surface:

- Usage and performance trends  
- Best-practice violations  
- Non-compliant workspaces  
- Developer optimization opportunities  

This platform helps BI leaders **identify governance gaps**, perform **root-cause analysis**, and maintain a **consistent, scalable reporting environment**.

## [Manufacture - Arista DPPM Report](https://github.com/RuipingWang06/Career_Project_Portfolio_Ruiping/blob/main/Arista_DPPM_Report.md) 

**Role:** Power BI Developer / Data Engineer  
**Tech Stack:** Power BI, SQL Server, Stored Procedures, SSRS / Paginated Reports
**Timeline:** (Jabil – Product Traceability Project)

**Project Overview**

A vendor-facing **traceability solution** that gave Arista clear visibility into material usage and defect locations across Jabil’s production lines, enabling them to analyze failures and improve supply quality.

Key contributions:

- Identified gaps between the BRD and actual data, and clarified the correct business logic  
- Redesigned the **end-to-end data flow** to support accurate component-to-defect mapping  
- Developed **stored procedures** to load clean, daily production and defect data  
- Built an **internal Power BI dashboard** for traceability monitoring  
- Delivered an **external paginated report** for Arista to support vendor analysis

This solution strengthened vendor collaboration and improved supply chain transparency.
