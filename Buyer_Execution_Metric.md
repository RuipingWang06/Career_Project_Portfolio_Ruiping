# **Business Impact**

Across 100+ Jabil plants, the lack of a **unified approach** to identify **urgent, unexecuted POs** caused **delivery delays**, **unnecessary purchases**, and recurring **multi-million-dollar losses**.

To address this, we built a **global PO lifecycle model** that integrates **PRs**, **Push-outs**, **Pull-ins**, **Cancellations**, **E&O classifications**, and **Past-Due POs**, providing **end-to-end visibility** across the entire process.

This solution **improved early-risk detection by 30–40%**, **reduced delays and excess spending**, **standardized workflows globally**, and strengthened **buyer accountability** through a Power App for logging un-execution reasons.

# **Lesson Learned**

This project taught me the importance of combining **strong governance**, **user-centric design**, and **cross-system integration**. I learned the value of building a **standardized Power BI workflow**—using **embedded data sources**, **data-limit parameters**, and **workspace pipelines**—to accelerate development, improve **version control**, and avoid errors across **DEV**, **STG**, and **PRD**.

I also realized that focusing on **usability details** such as **data periods**, **refresh dates**, **row counts**, **clickable KPI cards**, and **built-in user guides** can greatly increase **user adoption**.

Finally, integrating **Power Apps** to capture **un-execution reasons** and displaying them across report pages made the **PO execution lifecycle** far more **transparent** and **efficient**.
