# **Major Operation**
## **Project Background**

In May 2022, I joined a large-scale operations project worth approximately **10 million RMB**, the largest initiative of the year for our **Shanghai branch**. The project included both **ERP system upgrades** and **BI report development**.

The goal was to consolidate all key business metrics into a **single, consistent dashboard** to enable faster, **data-driven decisions** and ensure that all **11 regional companies** used the same **metric definitions**.

The dashboard contains **347 KPIs** covering essential real-estate performance indicators—such as **saleable inventory value**, **sell-through rate**, **supply-to-sales ratio**, **cash-collection rate**, and **profitability**—giving leaders a unified view to plan **future investments** and manage **cash flow** more effectively.
