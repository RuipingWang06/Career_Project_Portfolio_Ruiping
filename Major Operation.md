# **Major Operation**
## **Background**

This was the largest project in 2022 at the Mingyuan **Shanghai branch** for our client **Poly**. The scope included both an **ERP system upgrade** and **BI report development**.

The objective was to consolidate critical business metrics from **four ERP systems** (Sales, Cost, Planning, and Master Data) plus manual inputs into a **single, consistent dashboard**. This allowed all **11 regional companies** to use unified **metric definitions** and make faster, **data-driven decisions**.

The final dashboard delivered **347 KPIs** covering key real-estate performance metrics—including **saleable inventory value**, **sell-through rate**, **supply-to-sales ratio**, **cash-collection rate**, and **profitability**—providing leadership with a unified view to guide **investment planning** and improve **cash-flow management**.
