# **Business Impact**

The finance team at Jabil did not have a **unified** and **transparent** view of the full **PO-to-AP process**. Without visibility across **PO**, **GR**, **IR**, and **AP**, it was difficult to monitor **execution quality**, which resulted in **inefficient cash usage**, **delayed payments**, and repeated **multi-million-dollar financial losses**.

To solve this problem, we created an **integrated process framework** that **clearly defined** each step **end-to-end** and provided **data-driven insights** at every stage.

With this structure in place, we **improved cash utilization by 5–15%**, **shortened payment cycles by 10–20%**, **enhanced process stability**, and uncovered **major cost-saving opportunities** across the organization.

# **Lesson learned**

One key lesson is that effective report design requires a **business-analysis mindset**. A clear, top-down structure—from **overall KPIs**, to **sub-categories**, **monthly trends**, **dimensional analysis**, and finally **detailed tables**—helps users understand the logic and **trace each value back to its source**, which is essential for building **trust** in the report.

Another important lesson is the need to **confirm KPI definitions and dependencies early** with the business team. Many challenges come from the **underlying data**, and developers should not assume all logic is clear at the start. **Early alignment**, **assumption validation**, and **issue identification before UAT** are critical to ensuring **accuracy** and delivering a **reliable result**.
