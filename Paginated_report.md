# **Lesson Learned**

I learned how to build a paginated report on top of a **Power BI semantic model** using **M parameters** by working closely with **Microsoft Support**. Within two weeks, I opened **three support tickets**, collaborated with **five engineers**, and explored the core concepts independently. Since no online solution existed, the final fix came from a mix of **support escalation** and **independent problem-solving**, highlighting the value of **persistence** and **deep technical investigation**.
