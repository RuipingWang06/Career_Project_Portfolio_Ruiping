# **Project Impact**
This project improves visibility and governance across **1,000+ Power BI reports** by enabling proactive monitoring of **usage**, **performance**, and **best-practice compliance**. We built an **Azure-hosted Docker pipeline** where **Python** extracts metadata through **Microsoft AIP**, loads it into **AWS S3**, and feeds **Snowflake models** that power centralized analytics dashboards.

# **Contribution**
As a **Python/ETL developer**, I delivered 3 **Python** and 20 **ETL SQL scripts**, contributed to **data model design standards**, and helped establish **Snowflake development workflows** and **stored-procedure best practices**.

**Python Script:** Triggered the AIP process to extract and deliver metadata into AWS S3.

**Snowflake ETL SQL Development:**  
Designed and implemented the **ETL data flow** for the **PBIGOV** schema using **Snowpipe**, **Streams**, **stored procedures**, and **views** to ingest and transform data from **AWS S3** into **Snowflake**.
